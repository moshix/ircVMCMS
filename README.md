IRC client for VM/CMS
=====================

This is a client which runs on CMS on VM/SP, VM/ESA and z/VM to connect to the IRC chat servers out there. It works fine. 

This is an old repo I found on a University website in Germany. It's unclear who wrote it.   

rxsocket is included in vmarc form.   

have fun
